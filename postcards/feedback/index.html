	<h1>feedback for carmen</h1>
	<p>
		-The ones with 4-5 lines of text feel like too much to read for just a postcard.<br><br>
		-The shortened versions of the quotes on the mobile layouts are better.<br><br>
		-Try darkening some of the background images so the text shows up better- it's pretty hard to read in about half of them. <br><br>
		-Maybe positioning the text in areas of the photos where there's a lot of dark space would help?<br><br>
		-Most of all just make sure the white text isn't disrupted by business in the background & isn't on top of anything light in the photos.<br><br>
		-If there isn't a dark spot in the photo to move the text to maybe try a drop shadow.
