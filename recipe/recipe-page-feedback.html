	<br>"The way the fudge on the top is cut off personally bothers me. I don't mind that it's cut off on the bottom."
	<br>"I like the way you treated the titles and used different font weights."
	<br>"Do you need a degree symbol?"
	<br>"I like the process photos."
	<br>
	<br>Me: "Should I make the pot icon a scroll-to-top button?"
	<br>Claire: "I thought the pot icon was a button this whole time."
	<br>
	<br>"You should put the ingredients in the order of when you use them."
	<br>"Box shadow doesn't read as a shadow because the thing is so long."
	<br>"old-fashioned has a hyphen"

<h1>Tara says:</h1>

	<br>"Fit the ingredients to the smallest phone size possible, it wraps on thinner phones otherwise."
	<br>"Need more space between the images and text."
	<br>"On thinner phones the recipe goes out of the box."
	<br>"write that the fudge is dad's fudge or else the love dad is weird"
	<br>"I keep looking at that box shadow. It's kind of weird when you can't see the top or bottom. I'm 50-50. I don't think it's soooo distracting."
	<br>"You should add padding on the bottom of the box too."
